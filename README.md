# twitter-emotion
This is one of the tasks in the Data Intelligence course. In this project using the python programming language.
The final stage of text preprocessing is term-weighting. Term-weighting is the process of giving weight to the terms of the document. This weighting will be used later by the Machine Learning algorithm for document classification. There are several methods that can be used, one of which is TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

After that for the classification i using Multinomial Naive bayes, then the output is a emotion like "anger","happy","love","sadness" and anything (you can check in the csv file).
